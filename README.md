# Software-design-gameroom

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client?
The gaming room was the clients and they are currently working on a game application called draw it or lose it, initially made for android systems but now wish to expand their reach a little more this document is to help give a layout towards what i reccomend and the pros and cons of various different systems

What type of software did they want you to design?

The gaming room wanted to expand their client base by moving the game to different comupting platforms like mac linux and windows as well as mobile platforms increasing their reach and pulling in more consumers.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

i think my strongest point was my research and the options i provided while i may not of explained it as good as i could have i think my understanding of the different systems played a good part in my decisions.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

this project has helped me understand more on what im doing when it comes to the code being able to read it and check off stuff like bullets points made my workflow feel alot better and easier to understand rather than reading it in a coding languauge or terms.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

if i could choose one part it'd be the reccomendations i feel like i struggled to explain as well as i could.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

when interperting the users needs i took them as literally as possible in order to make sure that there was no confusion instead of thing that i could take short cuts i'd work on what they asked exactly rather than what i thought, its important to consider the usersneeds because they're the ones who will ultimately make it succecced or fail at the end of the day as the developer and company we are there to enchance the users experience and we are making this for them so we need them to be happy to make it work.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

i would follow the requirement list each week and each assignment and i would do my research into the topics that way i could make the best decision possible and if i made wrong or not a good choices i look more into it and why that way i gain a better understanding the farther i go into it and can make changes according to the feedback i was given
